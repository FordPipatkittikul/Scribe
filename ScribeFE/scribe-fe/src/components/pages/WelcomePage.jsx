                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>There are many situations where people need to take notes which 
                        have barriers to note taking. A project manager needs to record meeting 
                        minutes, but also run the meeting. A doctor needs to have a conversation 
                        with their patient and get a detailed record of their responses. A 
                        person with arthritis canâ€™t write notes for an entire lecture. All of 
                        these situations could be remedied with a personal Scribe. </p>

                        <h3 className='problem'>Problem</h3>
                        <p>Barriers to taking notes arise when the would-be writer is occupied 
                            by the situation at hand or otherwise impaired. They need a way to 
                            take notes without doing it themselves.</p>

                        <p>Scribe transcribes audio with the click of a button, and can generate 
                            notes from a text using an AI model.</p>
